## Logo Generation using AI

To generate a logo, you can use artificial intelligence tools such as [DALLÂ·E](https://openai.com/dall-e) or [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/). Once the logo is generated, place it in the `/public` folder with the name `logo.png`.

## Using the Linter

To make sure your code follows the project rules, run the linter:

yarn lint

## Fix errors with Linter
If you find errors, you can try to fix them automatically with the command:

yarn lint --fix

If you find errors that cannot be fixed automatically, review the marked code and fix it manually.

## CSS Linting
This project uses Stylelint to ensure that the CSS code adheres to predefined standards. To run the linter on your CSS files, use the following command:

yarn lint:css

This will analyze your CSS files and report any style issues or errors that need to be addressed.

â”œâ”€â”€ src/

â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
